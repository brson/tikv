//! Tests for the `engine_traits` crate
//!
//! These are basic tests that can be used to verify the conformance of
//! engines that implement the traits in the `engine_traits` crate.
//!
//! All engine instances are constructed through the `engine_test` crate,
//! so individual engines can be tested by setting that crate's feature flags.
//!
//! e.g. to test the `engine_sled` crate
//!
//! ```no_test
//! cargo test -p engine_traits_tests --no-default-features --features=protobuf-codec,test-engines-sled
//! ```
